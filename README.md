# ThinClient TUI

I wrote this as a tool for myself to make my Surface tablet into a "dumb terminal" (i.e. Thin Client). Basically, it is a TUI that runs on boot and replaces the standard Linux login screen. Once configured, connecting to a different machine (optionally with X11 forwarding) was a simple as selecting it from a menu. I added in a few bells and whistles for fun.

Overall, this was a cool and fun weekend project. I'm keeping it for archive now
